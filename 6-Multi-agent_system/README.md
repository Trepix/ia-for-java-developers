# Multi-agent System

⚠️ This project uses AspectJ, which is set as dependency in `pom.xml`. Also need to change how the project is compiled. There are 2 options:

* Set up the IDE to use AspectJ and **ajc** compiler. There is an example in this [link](http://tzachsolomon.blogspot.com/2015/08/how-to-create-hello-world-with-intellij.html).
* Modify `pom.xml` to build and run the project always through maven.
