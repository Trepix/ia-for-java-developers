Here you can find the examples of the book _Inteligencia Artificial para desarrolladores (en Java)_. These examples have suffered "just a little" refactor.

Refactoring the code helped me understand each chapter giving names to every concept, which was my main goal.

Also, in each exercise, I tried to achieve or practice something. Sometimes, I pushed to the edge some ideas sacrificing simplicity or performance.
